## Hasuara

Hasura is a graphQL engine that pairs with the postgres database and gives you fast and effective way to
get up and running as well operate a production graphQL endpoint. It actually is so fast to develop with
I dropped my previous prototyping approaches such as Firebase because it is just as fast and I am building
close the deployable endstate.

### Why use Hasura

If you have a new greenfield project and you are going to use graphQL, Hasura is a really, really
attractive option.

Having built graphQL resolvers with node.js express endpoints with Apollo and other approaches, Hasura
is pretty much superior in every way if you are willing to use postgres database and you do not expect
to be doing a lot of query level operations on the database or any unothodox logical data stitching or
other non-conventional data approaches.

## 3 Quick Options for a Development Setup

While there are other options such as other cloud providers or building the Hasura engine and running
postgres locally, I think these 3 options are good to quickly jump into Hasura and be up in running in
a few minutes.

### 1 - Docker (Locally)

### 2 - Heroku

### 3 - Digital Ocean
